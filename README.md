## MY EXCEL JOURNEY

The focus areas includes: 
1. Data generalisation
2. ETL(Extract, transform, and load)
3. Data life cycle
4. Notes on Data Analyis
5. Data entry in excel using tools like(LOOKUP,IF,OR,AND...)
6. Pivot table

 - DATA GENEARLISATION involves the general ways we source our raw data and this is directly proportional to our data literacy( Data literacy is how we percieve data or how we make meaning to data set.
Data sourced can either be structure or unstructured data. once the data is generated, it is then stored this process is called data storage. Data can be stored on Amazon, Premises, Goggle or Cloud. All data sourced can be worked on to provide a data driven decision making. After data generation, the data is stored and after that is done we draw statistice and can make decisions about it.
Data structure include: structured, semi structured, and unstructured data.
Structured data comes in tabular format and is 90% ready for analysis, semi structured is in a format like (JSON,XML), Unstructured data comes in audio files, video files and can be converted to structured format.
Data generation - Data storage - Statistics

- ETL(Extract, Transform,& Load)
